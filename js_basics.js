//1. Variables
//variables are declared using var keyword
var string = "Hello World!"; //the value of the variable string is Hello World!
var greeting = 'hey';
//You can retrieve the value by just calling the variable by name
//console.log(string);


//2. Comments
//You can put comments into JavaScript code, just like you can in CSS:
/*
Everything in between is a comment.
*/

//If your comment contains no line breaks, it's often easier to put it behind two slashes like this:
// This is a comment


//3. Operators
var total = 6 + 9;
var subtract = 29 - 10;
var say = "hello" + "world";


//4. Conditionals
var iceCream = 'chocolate';
if (iceCream === 'chocolate') {
  alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');    
} else {
  alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');    
};
